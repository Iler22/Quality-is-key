## Description
  
This project is a command line application that automatically generates a professional README markdown file for a repository based on answers from the user. When the application runs, it presents a series of prompts to the user to fill in sections in the README. Then the README markdown file with the user information is saved inside the output folder.

## Demonstration

Please see below demonstration of how to generate a README using the command line:
